# Triangle Type

## Description
Given three integers ( X, Y, and Z ) representing the three sides of a triangle, identify whether the triangle is Scalene, Isosceles, or Equilateral.
** One word: either "SCALENE" or "EQUILATERAL" or "ISOSCELES" (quotation marks excluded).

You may assume that  X,Y, and Z are positive integer and  sum of any two sides will be greater than the third.

Example 1:

```
Given nums = [ 2, 3, 4 ]
return "SCALENE"
```

Example 2:

```
Given nums = [ 2, 3, 4 ]
return "EQUILATERAL"
```
